NeuralDriver: A multi-layer perceptron back-propagation driver based on a hybrid neural/deterministic driver. The steering and brakes are controlled by seperate networks, that are found in this folder. 

Install SCR-server and get the SCR-server driver waiting for a connection. Build this project using Makefile (made for MingW on Windows, Linux makefile included but not tested) and run the generated ./neuralDrive.exe

Requires a "accBrakeNetwork.nn" and "steerNetwork.nn" file generated by networkManager.exe in the bpnn folder. Requires everything that SCR-server client needs to install to work http://xed.ch/h/torcs.html
